Information is stored in data form in computers. Data structures help organize and manage data.

Computational Complexity
 - how much time does this algorithm need to finish a task?
 - how much space does this algorithm need for its completion?

Big Notation 
 - big notation gives upper bound of the complexity in the worst case. basically the input is as complex as it can get.
 - n = the size of the input
 - constant time: 0(1)
 - log time: 0(log(n))
 - linear time: 0(n)
 - linearithmic time: 0(nlog(n))

Constant Time 0(1)
 - when the time taken doesn't depend on the input size

Linear Time 0(n)
 - when the time taken is directly proportional to the input size
 - f(n) x n 

Log Time 0(log(n))
 - 

N number of times a loop plays out

Static Array 
 - fixed length container containing elements indexable from range 0 to n-1
